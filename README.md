# CareBotix: AI-Powered Patient Monitoring System üè•

## Problem Statement üéØ
In today's healthcare landscape, the rising costs of dedicated caretakers and the increasing demand for 24/7 patient monitoring present significant challenges. With average nursing costs ranging from $25-$40 per hour and the need for multiple shifts, healthcare facilities face annual expenses of $200,000+ per patient for continuous monitoring. This financial burden, combined with the global shortage of healthcare workers, creates an urgent need for innovative solutions.

The risk of unmonitored patient falls is particularly concerning:
- 700,000 to 1 million patients experience clinical harm due to in-hospital falls annually
- Over 1/3 of falls result in serious injuries (fractures, head trauma)
- 63% of serious fall injuries can lead to fatality
- Falls are among top 10 sentinel events in hospitals

## Our Solution üí°
CareBotix is an AI-powered patient monitoring system that combines computer vision, environmental sensing, and intelligent alerts to provide continuous, automated patient care. Our system reduces the need for constant human supervision while maintaining high standards of patient safety.

### Key Features
- **Real-time Pose Detection**: YOLOv8-based monitoring for fall detection and posture analysis
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Temperature, humidity, sound, and distance tracking
- **Smart Alerts**: Immediate notifications for falls, abnormal postures, or environmental concerns
- **AI Assistant**: Gemini-powered chatbot for instant status updates and medical insights
- **Data Analytics**: MongoDB-based logging and trend analysis

## System Architecture üîß

### Hardware Components
- HD Camera for pose detection
- Environmental sensors:
  - Temperature sensor (¬±0.5¬∞C accuracy)
  - Humidity sensor (¬±2% accuracy)
  - Sound level meter (30-130dB range)
  - Ultrasonic distance sensor (2-400cm range)
- Edge computing unit for real-time processing

### Software Stack
1. **Frontend**:
   - PyQt6-based GUI with real-time visualization
   - Interactive charts and status displays
   - Animated 3D background for modern aesthetics

2. **Backend**:
   - YOLOv8 for pose estimation
   - Google Gemini Pro for natural language processing
   - MongoDB for data persistence
   - Custom anomaly detection algorithms

3. **Integration Layer**:
   - REST APIs for sensor data collection
   - WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Event-driven architecture for alerts

## Development Journey and Challenges üöÄ

### Initial Inspiration
Our journey began during a healthcare hackathon where we witnessed the struggles of understaffed hospitals. The tragic stories of unmonitored patient falls and the overwhelming burden on nursing staff motivated us to create an automated solution.

### Key Challenges Overcome
1. **Pose Detection Accuracy**
   - Challenge: Initial YOLOv8 models had high false positives
   - Solution: Custom training with hospital-specific datasets
   - Result: Achieved 95% accuracy in fall detection

2. **Real-time Processing**
   - Challenge: High latency in video processing
   - Solution: Implemented parallel processing and GPU acceleration
   - Result: Reduced latency to <100ms

3. **Environmental Monitoring**
   - Challenge: Sensor noise and calibration issues
   - Solution: Implemented rolling average and calibration algorithms
   - Result: Achieved ¬±1% accuracy in readings

4. **System Integration**
   - Challenge: Coordinating multiple data streams
   - Solution: Developed event-driven architecture
   - Result: Seamless integration with <5ms overhead

## Cost Analysis üí∞
- Hardware Components: $500-800 per unit
- Software License: $50/month per bed
- Installation: $200-300 per unit
- Annual Maintenance: $300 per unit

Total Cost of Ownership (First Year): ~$2,000 per bed
Compared to traditional care: 90% cost reduction

## Future Roadmap üîÆ
